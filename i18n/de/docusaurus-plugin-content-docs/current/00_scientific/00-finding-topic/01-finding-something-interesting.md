# Finding an interesting topic

After clarifying the difference between [topic and title](/scientific/finding-topic/differentiating-topic-title), it is now time to delve deeper into how one can actually find something to write about. What matters most here is the personal interest for a given subject, after all you have to spend hundreds of hours on research, experiments and writing in order to succeed in such an endeavor - it is therefore only natural to aim for something that interests you, otherwise you are in for a very long and rather exhaustive journey.

![Factors influencing the exploration of topics](/img/00_scientific/find_a_topic.png)

To help with finding potential subject areas, try creating a mind map using the template above - for starting out quantity is better than quality, so try to find as many potential topics as possible!

When choosing a topic, it is important to check a few points in mind to craft a result that has true scientific value:
-  Does the topic deal with something **novel** and therefore provides added value to the scientific community?
-  Do you **learn** something new when dealing with this topic?
-  Can the result of this work be **generalized** and reused for similar purposes?
-  Do you specify what you do and also what you **do not** do?
-  Are you able to include **[metrics](/category/methodology--evaluation)** to evaluate the success of your work?
-  Can you **finish** the work on that topic in the given timeframe?

__and most importantly:__
-  Are you personally **interested** in your topic?
-  Is it **fun** to delve into this topic?

If, and only if, you are able to tick all of these boxes, you can proceed with deriving a corresponding title and roadmap for your research project.
To help you with checking these boxes physically, you can download an extended checklist [here](/files/checklist_topic.pdf).
