# Assignment: Custom Data Model Design for a Business Scenario in SAP

#### Objective:

By the end of this assignment, attendees should be able to create a custom data model for a business scenario of their choice in an SAP system. The data model should include database tables, data elements, and CDS views.

#### Duration:

Approximately 2.5 hours

#### Instructions:

1. **Identify a Business Scenario**:
   Choose a business scenario that you would like to model. This could be anything from inventory management, customer relationship management, order processing, etc.

2. **Data Elements**:
   Define the data elements required for your business scenario. Each data element should have a meaningful name, a description, an associated data type, and a length.

For example, if you are modeling an inventory system, some data elements might include:

- Material Number
- Material Description
- Quantity
- Unit of Measure
- Price per Unit
- Warehouse Code
- Warehouse Description

3. **Database Tables**:
   Design the database tables required for your scenario using the data elements you defined. Each table should have a primary key and appropriate relationships.

For example, if you are modeling an inventory system, you might need:

- A Material Table to store material information.
- An Inventory Table to store inventory data.
- A Warehouse Table to store warehouse information.

Create and populate at least 4 tables.

4. **CDS Views**:
   Create CDS views to provide a summarized and filtered view of the data. Think about what kind of information would be useful for users and how it should be presented.

For example, in an inventory system, you might create:

- A view that shows the total quantity and total value of each material across all warehouses.
- A view that shows the quantity and value of materials in a specific warehouse.

Create at least 4 views.

5. **Documentation**:
   Document your data model in a Word document or similar format. Include:

- A brief description of the business scenario and the purpose of the data model.
- A list of the data elements with their definitions and data types.
- A diagram of the database tables showing their names, columns, primary keys, and relationships.
- Sample queries for each CDS view to demonstrate how they can be used.

#### Evaluation Criteria:

Your data model will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Accuracy and completeness of data elements.
- Correctness of database table design.
- Functionality and usefulness of CDS views.
- Quality of documentation.
- Creativity and relevance of the chosen business scenario.

Good luck! If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask your instructor.
