# Data Modeling Exercise

#### Objective:

By the end of this activity, you will have a fundamental understanding of data modeling and various modeling techniques, particularly Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD). You will be able to create and present a simple data model.

#### Assignment:

Your group will receive a specific task describing a real-world scenario. For example:

1. **University System:** Develop a data model for a university system that manages information about students, professors, courses, and grades.
2. **Online Shop:** Develop a data model for an online shop that manages products, customers, orders, and payments.
3. **Hospital Management:** Develop a data model for a hospital that manages information about patients, doctors, treatments, and bills.
4. **Library System:** Develop a data model for a library that manages information about books, members, loans, and reservations.

#### Flow:

1. **Introduction (10 minutes):**

- We will briefly explain the task and the objectives of this group activity.
- Each group will be given a specific scenario.
- We will introduce the concept of Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and their importance in data modeling.

2. **Research Activity (10 minutes):**

- Conduct a brief research on the basics of ERD.
- Points to consider:
- What are entities and relationships?
- How to represent an ERD?
- What symbols and notations are used?
- Use online resources such as Wikipedia, textbooks, or tutorials.

3. **Group Work (20 minutes):**

- Discuss and create a simple data model for your assigned scenario based on your research.
- Consider the following aspects:
- Identify the main entities (e.g., students, courses).
- Define relationships between entities (e.g., students are enrolled in courses).
- Determine the main attributes for each entity (e.g., student ID, name, date of birth).
- Use the researched ERD techniques to visualize the data model.
- Optionally: Sketch an example of an ABAP CDS view to represent part of the data model.

4. **Results Presentation (5 minutes per group):**

- Present your data model and explain the main entities, relationships, and attributes.
- Make your presentation interactive and creative. For example:
- Use flipcharts, whiteboards, or digital tools for visualization.
- Conduct short role-plays or scenarios to illustrate the use of the data model.
- Answer questions from other groups to deepen the understanding.

#### Materials:

- Flipcharts or whiteboards
- Pens and markers
- Optional digital tools (e.g., online whiteboards like Miro or Lucidchart)
- Example ERDs and ABAP CDS views for illustration
- Access to online resources for research

#### Feedback and Discussion (10 minutes):

- Provide collective feedback on the presentations and the created models.
- Discuss challenges and solutions.
- Summarize the main insights and learnings.
