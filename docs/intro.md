# A Brief Intro to Science

As confusing as it may seem at first, the art of scientific writing is not one that is overly hard to grasp. In all honesty, it might be easier to do scientific writing than it is to create fantasy worlds in novels such as The Lord of the Rings (I know, it does not seem that way in the beginning)! For now, just believe that this does, in fact, prove to be true and follow along to find out more and be amazed.

Why is is that scientific writing is easy, one might ask? Well, for starters: Scientific writing focuses solely on **facts** and **figures**, meaning there is no fiction or fantasy involved in the text. In fact, there should be no fantasy involved at all (especially not for inventing facts) - as that is what divides fiction from science here! This clear distinction makes it rather easy to get started, as one does not need to imagine a whole universe of characters, antagonists, creatures, and scenery, but one can simply rely on things that can be **observed**, **measured** or **proven** by empirical methods in conjunction with that what has already been researched before. This reliance on what has already been researched is one cornerstone of scientific work - we will later refer to this as using references and citations. But science **does** also have its very own characters of all kinds (although they tend to be less sword-wielding than the ones found in abovementioned books). They are represented by researchers and contributors that are scattered all over the world, providing factual and reviewed knowledge that propels the world's most innovative thinking forward, enabling everyone to advance their own knowledge and provide new approaches based on what has been discovered before. This provides great opportunities for each and everyone to also create something bold, just like the vast fantasy worlds that many of the world's best authors imagined! Sounds awesome, doesn't it? You just take a look at what has already been discovered and provide your own knowledge on top, just like a good film adaptation of a well-written book.

## Why should you read on?

Most probably you ended up here because somewhen in your life, someone told you to write a scientific paper - most probably related to some kind of academic achievement that you are pursuing. As this usually is not among the preferred student activities (and you most likely would rather be out doing other, more fun things currently) this guide aims to ease your pain by providing best practices when dealing with such science. Additionally, it tries to provide you with templates, methods and little helpers to make scientific writing not only bearable, but perhaps even fun! If you do not feel like reading all of this, just skip ahead to whatever portion you deem necessary for your own success (they are all neatly organized in the sidebar).
