# What is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)?

 Imagine you're at a fancy dinner party, and you're in charge of setting up the tables. Each plate, fork, knife, and napkin has a specific place and purpose. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is kind of like being the party planner for a webpage - so let's get the party started!

 To plan a fancy dinner party, we need labels - they help us to organize everything neatly so that each and every item has its own place (and also appears at the right location). Such a label might tell our guests where to sit, or indicate where the plates and cutlery should be - after all, we don't want the cutlery to be on the floor and the plate to be on the ceiling, right? So how can we ensure that everything goes exactly as planned? In HTML, we use so-called **tags** to indicate the position of items - just as we would use placement cards to indicate the seating of our guests.
