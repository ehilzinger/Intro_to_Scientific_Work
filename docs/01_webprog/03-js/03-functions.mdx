# Functions

Until now, the JavaScript code that we saw was not encapsulated in any way. As this leads to cluttered and incomprehensible programs, it is necessary to structure the coding
in a way that makes it reusable and understandable - this is where functions come into play.

<details>
  <summary>Functions vs. Methods</summary>
    <>The difference between functions and methods lies mainly therein that functions are not bound to any class and can exist on their own, whereas methods
    are usually attached to a class and therefore exist in object-oriented programming languages. Functionality-wise, they both provide a way to encapsulate
    coding and to enable reusability of that coding by simply calling the function or method.</>
