# Variables and Data Types

## Variables

After printing out your first "Hello World", it is time to dive deeper into variables and datatypes. When we talk about variables, we usually refer to some construct that 
can store a value of one kind or another. This is depicted below:

![Variables Intro](/img/01_webprog/variables.png) 

Here, we can see three variables storing different datatypes such as string, integer and double (or float point).

Creating a variable in JavaScript can easily be done in a two different ways:
```js 
let foo = "Hello World";
var bar = 123;
```

In the code block, we declare three variables ```foo``` and ```bar``` and immediately assign a value to them. We could also only declare the variables without the initial value assignment,
which would simply reduce the statement to ```let foo;```.

:::note
Notice that there is a difference between ```let``` and ```var``` when declaring a variable, which we will cover when talking about functions later on.
:::

These two variables can be changed by reassigning a value to them, whereas a constant cannot be changed and thus should have a value upon declaration:
```js 
const doe = 123.45;
```

A reassignment of the constant value `doe` is therefore not possible! Trying to reassign it anyway using a subsequent `doe = 567` will result in a type error. Try it out:

## Data Types

You have already seen some data types above - to be precise, we used the types `String` (for the variable `foo`) and `Number` (for the variables `bar` and `doe`). There exist, however,
more datatypes in JavaScript:

| Data Type        | Description | Example |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| String      | A sequence of alphanumerical characters enclosed in single or double quotes        | ```let foo = "Hello World"```
| Number   | A number - these are not enclosed in quotes and can have decimal places        | `let bar = 123`
| Object   | Basically anything - everything in JavaScript is represented as an object and can be stored in a variable (also functions!)        | `let obj = {}` (and all other examples contained here)
| Array   | A data structure able to store multiple values  | `let arr = [1, 'ABC', {}]` (note: we can use varying data types in this structure)
| Boolean   | A binary value being either true or false (representing '1' or '0') | `let bool = true`
