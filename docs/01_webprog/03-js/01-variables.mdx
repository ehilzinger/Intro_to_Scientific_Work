# Variables and Data Types

After printing out your first "Hello World", it is time to dive deeper into variables and datatypes. When we talk about variables, we usually refer to some construct that 
can store a value of one kind or another. This is depicted below:

![Variables Intro](/img/01_webprog/variables.png) 

Here, we can see three variables storing different datatypes such as string, integer and double (or float point).

Creating a variable in JavaScript can easily be done in a two different ways:
```js 
let foo = "Hello World";
var bar = 123;
```

In the code block, we declare three variables ```foo``` and ```bar``` and immediately assign a value to them. We could also only declare the variables without the initial value assignment,
which would simply reduce the statement to ```let foo;```.

:::note
Notice that there is a difference between ```let``` and ```var``` when declaring a variable, which we will cover when talking about functions later on.
:::

These two variables can be changed by reassigning a value to them, whereas a constant cannot be changed and thus should have a value upon declaration:
```js 
const doe = 123.45;
```

A reassignment of the constant value `doe` is therefore not possible! Trying to reassign it anyway using a subsequent `doe = 567` will result in a type error. Try it out:
