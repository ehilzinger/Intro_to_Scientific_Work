# What is JavaScript?


![JavaScript venn diagram](/img/01_webprog/js_venn.png)

When hearing the name, you might think that this is some kind of weird mix between Java and some other scripting language - it definitely is not. JavaScript has as much in common with Java as apples have in common with pineapples - they are both programming languages (not the apple obviously).
What they were initially created for differs largely, with Java being a statically typed, strictly object oriented language, whereas JavaScript was designed as a very simple scripting language to be used on websites.
