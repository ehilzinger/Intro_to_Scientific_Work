# What is JavaScript?


![JavaScript venn diagram](/img/01_webprog/js_venn.png)

When hearing the name, you might think that this is some kind of weird mix between Java and some other scripting language - it definitely is not. JavaScript has as much in common with Java as apples have in common with pineapples - they are both programming languages (not the apple obviously).
What they were initially created for differs largely, with Java being a statically typed, strictly object oriented language, whereas JavaScript was designed as a very simple scripting language to be used on websites.

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language primarily used for enhancing web pages to create interactive and dynamic user experiences. Developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications Corporation, JavaScript has evolved from a simple scripting tool to one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It runs on virtually every web browser, making it a cornerstone technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. As you begin your journey with JavaScript, you'll discover its power to bring web pages to life and its critical role in the ever-evolving landscape of web development. Furthermore, the use of JavaScript is not limited to only web development - in fact, you can create sophisticated applications using only JavaScript! Thanks to Node.js, it is possible to execute JavaScript code outside of webbrowsers, making the language platform independent and very versatile for a wide variety of potential usage scenarios.
