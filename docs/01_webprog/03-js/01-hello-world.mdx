# Your first program

Let's get started with a very simple "Hello World" example in JavaScript!
This is as simple as typing out the following code:
```js 
    console.log("Hello World")
```

As you can see, we do not need to declare any import or dependency in order to be able to access the ```console.log()``` function - it is built into JavaScript's [web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API), enabling quick and easy access.

Try to write your first program below!
