# Data Types and Structures

Python is a versatile programming language, widely used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, and automation. A key strength is its simplicity, making it accessible for beginners and powerful for experts. Here’s a comprehensive look at Python’s data types and structures:

---

### 1. **Data Types**

Python has several built-in data types that form the foundation for all operations. The main types include:

- **Numeric Types**  
  Python supports integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

  ```python
  # Integer
  x = 5

  # Float
  y = 3.14

  # Complex number
  z = 2 + 3j
  ```

- **Boolean**  
  The Boolean type has two values: `True` and `False`.

  ```python
  is_python_fun = True
  ```

- **Strings**  
  Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.

  ```python
  greeting = "Hello, World!"
  multi_line_string = '''This is
  a multi-line string.'''
  ```

  Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation. You can access elements of a string via indexing and slicing:

  ```python
  # Indexing
  first_char = greeting[0]  # H

  # Slicing
  hello = greeting[:5]  # Hello
  ```

- **None Type**  
  Represents the absence of a value and is used to signify 'nothing' or 'null.'

  ```python
  x = None
  ```

### 2. **Data Structures**

Python has built-in data structures that allow you to store and manipulate data effectively.

- **Lists**  
  Lists are mutable sequences that can contain items of any data type.

  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  fruits.append("orange")
  ```

  Lists are ordered, and you can access elements using indices.

  ```python
  first_fruit = fruits[0]  # "apple"
  ```

- **Tuples**  
  Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed once created.

  ```python
  coordinates = (10, 20)
  ```

  Tuples are useful for storing data that should not change.

- **Dictionaries**  
  A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs. Dictionaries are mutable and unordered.

  ```python
  student = {"name": "John", "age": 21}
  student["grade"] = "A"
  ```

  Access values by their keys:

  ```python
  name = student["name"]  # "John"
  ```

- **Sets**  
  Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful when you want to avoid duplicates.

  ```python
  unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
  ```

  Sets can be modified and support operations like union, intersection, and difference.

  ```python
  odd_numbers = {1, 3, 5}
  even_numbers = {2, 4, 6}
  union_set = odd_numbers | even_numbers  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  ```

### 3. **Advanced Structures**

In addition to basic data structures, Python offers more specialized structures for advanced use cases:

- **Lists Comprehensions**  
  These provide a concise way to create lists using loops and conditions.

  ```python
  squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
  ```

- **Dictionary Comprehensions**  
  Similar to list comprehensions but used to construct dictionaries.

  ```python
  squares_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(10)}
  ```

- **Tuples as Immutable Sequences**  
  Although immutable, tuples are often used for returning multiple values from a function.

  ```python
  def get_coordinates():
      return (10, 20)

  x, y = get_coordinates()
  ```

---

### 4. **Type Conversion**

Python allows easy conversion between different types using built-in functions:

- Convert a string to an integer:

  ```python
  num_str = "100"
  num_int = int(num_str)
  ```

- Convert an integer to a string:

  ```python
  num = 100
  num_str = str(num)
  ```

Type conversion is essential when working with input/output or combining different types.

### Conclusion

Python’s rich set of data types and structures allows developers to build scalable, readable, and efficient applications. Mastering them is essential for anyone looking to dive deep into Python programming.
