# Functions

Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They help organize code, promote reusability, and simplify complex operations.

---

### 1. **Defining a Function**

A function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. Here's the basic syntax:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code to be executed
    return result
```

Example:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

This function takes a `name` parameter and returns a greeting.

---

### 2. **Calling a Function**

To execute a function, simply "call" it by writing its name followed by parentheses. You can pass arguments that correspond to the function’s parameters.

```python
print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

---

### 3. **Parameters and Arguments**

- **Parameters** are variables listed inside the function definition. 
- **Arguments** are the actual values passed when calling the function.

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7
```

Functions can accept multiple parameters, and Python also supports default parameters:

```python
def greet(name="stranger"):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet())  # Output: Hello, stranger!
```

---

### 4. **Return Statement**

Functions in Python use the `return` statement to send a result back to the caller. If no `return` is used, the function returns `None` by default.

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

print(square(5))  # Output: 25
```

---

### 5. **Positional and Keyword Arguments**

- **Positional arguments** are passed to functions based on their order.
- **Keyword arguments** are passed by explicitly specifying the parameter names.

```python
def introduce(name, age):
    return f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."

print(introduce("Alice", 30))            # Positional arguments
print(introduce(age=30, name="Alice"))   # Keyword arguments
```

---

### 6. **Arbitrary Arguments**

If you don’t know how many arguments a function will receive, use `*args` for positional arguments or `**kwargs` for keyword arguments.

- **`*args`** allows passing a variable number of arguments as a tuple.

  ```python
  def sum_numbers(*args):
      return sum(args)

  print(sum_numbers(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 6
  ```

- **`**kwargs`** allows passing a variable number of keyword arguments as a dictionary.

  ```python
  def print_info(**kwargs):
      for key, value in kwargs.items():
          print(f"{key}: {value}")

  print_info(name="Alice", age=30)  # Output: name: Alice, age: 30
  ```

---

### 7. **Lambda Functions**

Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They can have any number of arguments but only one expression.

```python
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(5))  # Output: 25
```

These are often used for short, throwaway functions.

---

### 8. **Scope of Variables**

The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed in a program:

- **Local variables**: Declared inside a function and only accessible within that function.
- **Global variables**: Declared outside all functions and accessible from any function in the program.

```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def my_function():
    x = 5  # Local variable
    print(x)

my_function()  # Output: 5
print(x)       # Output: 10
```

To modify a global variable inside a function, use the `global` keyword:

```python
def update_global():
    global x
    x = 20
```

---

### 9. **Recursive Functions**

A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. It’s useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems (e.g., calculating factorials).

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

Recursive functions need a **base case** to stop the recursion and avoid infinite loops.

---

### 10. **Higher-Order Functions**

Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return functions are called higher-order functions.

Example using `map()` to apply a function to each item in a list:

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)
print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

---

### Conclusion

Functions are one of the most powerful tools in Python, enabling code modularity, reusability, and efficiency. By mastering them, you will significantly improve your ability to write clear, maintainable code.
