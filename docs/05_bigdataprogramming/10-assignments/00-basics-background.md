# Big Data Basics

### **1. Big Data Use Cases**
**Task**: Research and present **real-world examples** of Big Data applications across different industries (e.g., healthcare, finance, retail, social media).
- **Deliverables**: A presentation that highlights at least 3 use cases of Big Data in different industries. Include the problems Big Data helped solve, the type of data involved, and the impact on decision-making or performance.
  
---

### **2. Big Data vs. Traditional Data**
**Task**: Investigate and compare **Big Data** with traditional databases and data processing methods.
- **Deliverables**: A comparison chart or infographic showing the differences between Big Data and traditional data systems. Focus on factors like volume, velocity, variety, and the technologies used.
  
---

### **3. The 5 Vs of Big Data**
**Task**: Explore and explain the **5 Vs of Big Data**: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value.
- **Deliverables**: Create a visual presentation or poster that defines and gives real-world examples of each V. Discuss how each characteristic affects how data is processed and stored.

---

### **4. Data Privacy and Ethics in Big Data**
**Task**: Research the **ethical challenges** and privacy concerns related to Big Data.
- **Deliverables**: A group debate or panel discussion, with each team member taking a different stance (e.g., the company’s perspective, the consumer’s perspective, the regulator’s perspective). Conclude with a summary of the most critical privacy challenges and proposed solutions.

---

### **5. Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**
**Task**: Investigate and compare **horizontal scaling** (adding more servers) and **vertical scaling** (adding more power to one server).
- **Deliverables**: A side-by-side analysis (e.g., slide deck or diagram) outlining the pros and cons of each approach. Include real-world examples of companies that use horizontal or vertical scaling.

---

### **6. Batch vs. Stream Processing**
**Task**: Compare **batch processing** and **stream processing** and identify situations where each method is more effective.
- **Deliverables**: Create a decision tree or flowchart that helps companies decide when to use batch vs. stream processing, based on factors like data size, processing time, and use case scenarios.

---

### **7. Overview of Distributed Processing Systems**
**Task**: Research **distributed processing** and identify key technologies and frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka.
- **Deliverables**: An overview of each framework, its main purpose, and examples of companies or projects that use it. Present findings in a group discussion or as an interactive Q&A with the class.

---

### **8. Big Data Architecture**
**Task**: Research different types of **Big Data architectures** (e.g., Lambda, Kappa, Data Lakes).
- **Deliverables**: A visual diagram of each architecture, including a brief description of how data flows through the system. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each in terms of scalability, complexity, and use cases.

---

### **9. Big Data Frameworks Showdown**
**Task**: Each group chooses a **Big Data framework** (Hadoop, Spark, Flink, Kafka, etc.) and dives deep into its features, uses, and limitations.
- **Deliverables**: A mini "framework showdown" where each group member pitches their chosen technology to the class, explaining why it’s the best tool for specific Big Data tasks.

---

### **10. Current Trends and Future of Big Data**
**Task**: Research **current developments** and the future of Big Data, focusing on emerging technologies, trends like edge computing, and the integration of AI and machine learning.
- **Deliverables**: A group presentation highlighting the most exciting innovations in Big Data. Include predictions for the next 5-10 years, backed up by research from recent articles, blogs, and industry reports.

---

### **Bonus Assignment: Big Data in Everyday Life**
**Task**: Explore how Big Data is used in **daily life**, from social media to online shopping, and how it affects consumer behavior.
- **Deliverables**: A creative presentation or video illustrating the journey of a data point, from its creation (e.g., when you like a post on Instagram) to how it’s processed, analyzed, and used to influence decisions or recommendations.
